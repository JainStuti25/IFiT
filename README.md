**iFit Android App**

Since we all know how much difficult it is to get bed at Hospitals due to increasing cases of medical unfitness in todayâ€™s era. We also aim to build a part through which a user can ask for blood through the app itself. The app will send request to the Blood Bank and all the users with the specified blood group. In this manner, users can get even the rarest blood group in minimum time. 

**Our Approach**

The idea of our app is simple yet useful and handy. We propose to build an android app which allows users to get doctor appointments online, and even ask for bed in case of emergency online. Thus saving time and precious lives. 

***Features***

- ChatBot to interact with the users when they feel exhausted or down.
- Asking for Bed at Hospitals during Emergency.
- User can raise blood Request using Alerts.
- Emergency call to Important contacts.
